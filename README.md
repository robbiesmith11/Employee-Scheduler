Employee Shift Scheduler:

This application is to demonstrate different algorithms and approaches of dealing with an employee scheduling optimisation problem.
After realising the potential for real world use i devoloped and User Interface (UI) to help guide users through the process and optimise their problems.

Features : 

-Maximum of one shift per employee per day.
-Adherence to minimum and maximum working hours per employee.
-Scheduling based on employee availability.
-Meeting group demand per day.
-Optimization for minimizing total working hours and maximizing skilled employees per shift

Conditions:

-The format of the example datasets must be used when applying your own.

How to use:

-create a copy of the github repository
-download the example datasets
-install requirements.txt
-run the schedulingOA file on your IDE
-it then might come up with an error, however this is because it assumes the streamlit website is already running on your device.
-from the terminal copy and paste the " streamlit run (file path name) " and run it in the terminal
-a new window should then pop up. You can then refer to the UI's "how to use" on running the optimisation

Built with :

Python - The programming language used.
OR-Tools - For constraint programming.
Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy - For numerical operations.
Streamlit - For creating the web application.
Matplotlib - For generating visualizations.
